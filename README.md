# Challenge: Hot and Cold


In the Hot or Cold guessing game, the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player then tries to guess the number. The player gets feedback for each guess â€“ "hot" if their guess was close, and "cold" if their guess was far. When the user guesses the secret number, the app lets them know, and they'll have the option to start a new game.

You can see a version of the game running here. Note that this app is implemented using jQuery, not React. It also takes a more fine-grained approach to providing feedback on guesses ("Hot", "Cold", "Kinda hot") that is not a requirement for your app.

## Requirements
Create a new local React project using Create React App.
Begin by breaking the UI into separate sections, and creating static, stateless components for each piece.
You should be able to see a complete static version of your user interface before working on the interactivity.
Add state to your components where necessary to store information about the current progress through the game.
You might want to think about storing some or all of the following:
The current number which the user is trying to guess.
The user's most recent guess.
A history of the user's guesses.
The feedback currently being displayed to the user.
The different options for feedback that the user can be given.
Add interactivity so your components respond to the user making a guess, and update the state accordingly.
